# Todo mock server

This mock server is built by [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). All the mocked data are put in file `db.json`. 

## Start mock server

Please clone or download this project to your local, and use `npm` or `yarn` to install the dependences and start server:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Or

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

Then you can access `http://localhost:3001/todos/` to see if the server is started correctly.

## APIs

Also here are some APIs you might want to use:

### Get todo list

```
GET http://localhost:3001/todos
```

The response of this request would be the json of all todos list.

### Get one todo

```

{
    "headers": {

    },
    "body": {MODIFIED AGENT}
}
```

Then the todo item which match which the id will be updated and be replaced with the modified todo item.
